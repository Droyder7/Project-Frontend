lots of changes are done over here that i can't tell in a single commit

sing up & signin are done
private user route are created
user dashboard prototype has been created


considering user is a JSON object, I have made a loop to fetch his watchlist

now it's tough for me to work with without having a proper idea regarding  user JSON object




things to do:--

only main thing that I have to do now is to work on user dashboard file
and api call

user dashboard should have buttons to --- > add and remove a watchlist
                                      ---- > add and remove a stock present in a specific watchlist
                                      ---- > add or remove his titeria of notification regarding a particular stock
                                      ---- > apply the algorithm
                                      ---- > give the notification at a certain time

    I must need to know the structure of user JSON object
